# DAA

This GitHub repository contains code implementations for four optimization algorithms: 
Genetic Algorithm, Cultural Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization.
These algorithms are commonly used in the field of computational intelligence and can be used for a wide range of optimization problems.
