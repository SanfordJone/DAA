This GitHub repository contains code implementations for four optimization algorithms: 
Genetic Algorithm, Cultural Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization.
These algorithms are commonly used in the field of computational intelligence and can be used for a wide range of optimization problems.

After experimenting using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Cultural Algorithm (CA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms, I found that GA gave the best accuracy for the problem.GA's crossover and mutation operators were able to maintain a balance between exploration and exploitation, which helped it avoid getting stuck in local optima. This allowed GA to consistently outperform the other algorithms in terms of accuracy.However, I acknowledge that the performance of each algorithm can vary depending on the parameters used.
